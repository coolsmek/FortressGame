# Fortress Game (Unity Engine)
**Multiplayer FPS Game that is centered around building up your own personal army and fortresses with your friends**

## To do:
- design FPS controller with ability to change between standing, crouching, and prone states
- design basic weapon interactions (client side) for good player feedback and responsiveness
- create models of players, weapons, intractable objects, and fortress building components (walls, barriers, bunkers, etc.)
- create player/weapon animations for both FPS view and 3rd person view and integrate into Mechanim systems
- design menu interface for client side fortress building (UX design)
- design resource management system for maintain player personal and overall battalion wealth.
- design system for managing/creating your own battalion, squads, and the hierarchies involved. (UI for players and back-end data)

Will try and keep this updated with current objectives to keep the project moving forward. : )
