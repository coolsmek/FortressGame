# Fortress Game (Unity Engine)
**Multiplayer FPS Game that is centered around building up your own personal army and fortresses with your friends**

## To do:
- design FPS controller with ability to change between standing, crouching, and prone states
- design basic weapon interactions (client side) for good player feedback and responsiveness
- create models of players, weapons, intractable objects, and fortress building components (walls, barriers, bunkers, etc.)
- create player/weapon animations for both FPS view and 3rd person view and integrate into Mechanim systems
- design menu interface for client side fortress building (UX design)
- design resource management system for maintain player personal and overall battalion wealth.
- design system for managing/creating your own battalion, squads, and the hierarchies involved. (UI for players and back-end data)

Will try and keep this updated with current objectives to keep the project moving forward. : )

### **This repository will not contain any "art" assets (textures, models, sounds) becuase these types of files tend to be large. This repository is for maintaining unity scenes, prefabs, materials, and code files. Art will be maintained on Google Drive and should be pulled from there.**
